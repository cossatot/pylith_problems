## Stresses
### General
- Do topo stresses need to be explicitly balanced beforehand with BC stresses?
- Balanced 'tectonic' stresses could indicate that over the EQ cycle, these stresses are balanced by variable stress drop
- No necessary balance would mean... not that.

### How to apply tectonic stresses
- make 1d (line), top to bottom of model, w/ 0 at 0 and whatever at bottom
- Have x_neg = x_pos, y_neg=y_pos
- z = free [?]
